# TREYFER2
TREYFER2 Encryption source code in C.

TREYFER2 was released in 2005.It has exactly the same design as TREYFER but it no longer works on 64-bit blocks, instead it works on 128-bit blocks like AES.

With TREYFER2 subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function, representing 8192 bits. Thus attacks against TREYFER do not work with TREYFER2.
